## Simple example of what you should NOT do...

.center[
<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/wrongBarChart.jpg", width = 60%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]

---

## Another example ...

.center[
<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/uglyBarChart.jpg", width = 60%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]

---
## Another example ...

.center[
<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/badBarChart.jpg", width = 60%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]

---
## Finally, a half-way decent chart...

.center[
<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/goodBarChart.jpg", width = 60%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]

## Mapping data onto aesthetics

All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics.

## Components of Graphs

.pull-left[
<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/aestheticTypes.jpg", width = 100%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]
--
.pull-right[
- A critical component is the x,y position
- There could be other coordinate systems: Polar coordinates, or 3D coordinates
- All graphical elements have a shape, size and color
- Lines could have different widths, or dash-dot patterns
- Fonts: font family, font face, font size

#### Identify the Data Types
---

## Graph from Temperature Dataset

.pull-left[
<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/temperatureGraph.png", width = 100%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]
--
.pull-right[
- Fairly standard visualization for a temperature curve
- Map temperature onto Y Axis
- Map "day of the year" to the X Axis
- Map location onto color
- Visualize these aesthetics with solid lines
]
---

## Alternate Graph from Temperature Dataset

<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/temperatureGraph2.png", width = 70%, style = "position:relative"></img>

--

- We could map Location to Y Axis
- Map Temperature to Color
- As the key variable of interest, temperature, is shown as color, we need to show sufficiently large colored areas for the color to convey useful information
- Therefore, we are using squares instead of lines, one for each month and location
- Used the Average Temperature of each month
- Month and Location are discrete (Month is ordered, while Location is not)
- As location is not ordered, we can decide the order - chose an aesthetically pleasing order - pleasant staggering of colors

.center[
## Graph with five scales

<img src = "visualDesignPrinciples_files/graphWithFiveScales.png", width = 50%, style = "position:relative"></img>
]
--

- Previous graphs had three scales (two positions and one color) 
- This graph has 5 scales (two position scales, one color scale, one size scale, one shape scale)
