1. How many rows are in penguins? How many columns?

2. What does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe? Read the help for ?penguins to find out.

3. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

4. What happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?

5. What does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.

6. Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for labs().

7. The mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run mpg?

8. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to color, then size, then both color and size, then shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?

9. In the scatterplot of hwy vs. displ, what happens if you map a third variable to linewidth?

10. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

11. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm and color the points by species. What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by species?
